This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical loan application datasets to identify patterns and factors contributing to loan defaults. The analysis provides insights into borrower demographics, credit history, and repayment behavior, enabling banks to implement preventive measures such as adjusting loan amounts, revising interest rates, or declining high-risk applications.
